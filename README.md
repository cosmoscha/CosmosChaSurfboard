# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

# Surfboard coding challenge

We expect this assignment to take 1 hour to program. You may use any stack, import any third-party libraries, consult any documentation, and use any existing code that you have written or otherwise are legally allowed to be used (such as open source). However, given that our stack is written in `React` and `TypeScript`, we would prefer that you use those.

# Implementation

Please design and implement a product for users to run investor meetings in. Your product should meet the following product requirements, at a minimum:

- An agenda
    - A list of meeting topics
        - Each topic contains a title, time estimate, and a text description
    - Users should be able to navigate between topics
    - The presenter should be able to add, delete and edit topics

### Extra credit

If you've finished the product requirements above, the following would also be cool (though not necessary):

- Your design is easy to use
- Users can communicate with each other in some way (chat, audio, etc.)
- Some way to keep track of whether the meeting is running on time
- Topics have content beyond normal text (like rich text, links, images, attachments)
- Users can see who is looking at which topics
- Other features not listed here that you think would be useful for the user

# Demo

Please record a short 5 minute video of your solution.

- Demonstrate the product and how it is used
- Explain your code at a high level. (Architecture decisions, stack, design, ...)
- You may also discuss any problems you ran into and how you dealt with them

# Submission

Please send an email to team@surfboard.team with the following:

- Link to your code (such as a git repository or repl.it)
- Link to your video
